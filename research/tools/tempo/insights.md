## Unique Differentiators

## Key Limitations

### 1. Post-Acquisition Pricing Shift
Tempo's acquisition of Roadmunk changed the target market:

> "Prices jumped. Minimum user requirements appeared. The focus shifted to enterprise."

The original SMB-friendly Roadmunk became enterprise-focused Strategic Roadmaps.

### 2. Mobile Limitations
> "While you can access and view roadmaps on mobile devices, the functionality and editing abilities are limited."

Modern product work increasingly happens on mobile; this is a gap.

### 3. Analytics Weakness
G2 scores analytics at 6.9/10, lowest among rated features. Limited reporting and insights compared to competitors.

### 4. Integration Breadth
Fewer native integrations than competitors:
- No native Slack
- No native Salesforce
- No native Intercom
- Manual workarounds required for some tools

### 5. Customization Complexity
> "While Roadmunk offers extensive customization options, it can sometimes feel overwhelming to navigate through the numerous settings and configurations."

Power comes with complexity trade-off.

## Summary

Tempo Strategic Roadmaps (formerly Roadmunk) has evolved from an accessible startup roadmapping tool into an enterprise-focused component of Tempo's comprehensive PPM suite. Its deep Jira integration and beautiful visualizations make it compelling for Atlassian-centric organizations.

The post-acquisition shift toward enterprise pricing and features has opened opportunities for competitors in the SMB space. However, for organizations already invested in Jira and needing a complete PPM solution, Tempo's suite offers unique value.

The key question for buyers: Is your organization Jira-centric and enterprise-scale? If yes, Tempo is a strong choice. If not, alternatives may offer better value and fit.
