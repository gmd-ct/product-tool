**Founded**: 2009 (Iceland)
**Headquarters**: Boston, Massachusetts
**Focus**: Project, Product & Portfolio Management for Jira

## Company History

Tempo was born from practical necessity. Ten years ago, Pétur Ágústsson was working at an IT consulting firm in Iceland when he and his colleagues needed a better way to track time in Jira for billing purposes. They built an app that solved the problem, and Tempo launched its time tracking app in 2009.

In 2015, Tempo spun off from the consulting firm to become its own company with close to 100 employees and 11,000 customers. The company was acquired by Diversis Capital in November 2018, with a last known valuation of $250M as of July 2020.
