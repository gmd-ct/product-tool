# Airfocus - Key Insights & Analysis

## Unique Differentiators

### 1. First Modular Product Management Platform
Airfocus pioneered the modular approach to product management:

> "The world's first modular product management tool"

### 3. Exceptional Customer Support
Consistently praised across all review platforms:

> "Sometimes when I ask questions I receive short video tutorials created for my specific use case."

**Why It Matters**: Complex tools need great support. Airfocus invests heavily here.

### 4. Enterprise Security with EU Hosting
SOC 2, ISO 27001:2022, GDPR compliance with EU data hosting option.

**Why It Matters**: European companies and regulated industries need local data hosting and strong compliance.
