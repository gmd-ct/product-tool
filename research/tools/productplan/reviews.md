## Capterra Review Analysis

### Detailed Pros (User Quotes)

#### Ease of Use
> "Product Plan has struck the balance between staying easy to use while also offering a ton of flexibility."

> "The best benefit, for me, is how simple to use but effective it is. Compared to MS Project and other tools, it didn't take me hours of watching videos to create my first roadmap."

> "I found ProductPlan the easiest and most versatile to use among several roadmap products evaluated. It didn't box me in, but instead offered me the flexibility to start where I wanted to in the process."

#### Visual Communication
> "I love how simple it is to create visually pleasing Roadmaps that tell the right story for each stakeholder group."

> "Being able to share a 'view only' version of roadmaps to non-users and embed in wiki pages is a huge plus."

#### Feature Richness
> "ProductPlan is feature rich and has everything that a Product Manager needs to see not only the detail view of any given project, but also the macro view across all of his/her projects in a rolled-up view."

> "Roadmaps can be exported in a Board-friendly format that is easy to digest."

> "Great tools for backlog management and prioritization."

#### Integration Value
> "The Jira integration adds so much value, giving you up-to-date status on the implementation/engineering effort."

### Detailed Cons (User Quotes)

#### Support Quality (Mixed)
> "Previous experience with their support team were often underwhelming." (September 2024)

#### Pricing Concerns
> "Very poor also that SSO requires extra payment." (January 2022 - Note: SSO now included)

#### UI/UX Limitations
> "Some aspects of it are almost too simple. I want more freedom with font size and placement of text to make the output look cleaner, especially when printing."

> "The UI is in need of an overhaul to use modern UI/Angular framework."

#### Missing Features
> "Missing the ability to move bars (story features) between lanes (projects) without having to drag and drop - would like a right-click option."

> "Minor issues with scaling of gantt chart bar height which would help showing charts on monitors that don't allow zoom-scaling."

### Overall Sentiment
> "I've been very happy with ProductPlan, both as a software package and as a company. I don't feel like ProductPlan wastes my time—either in its software or in its marketing."
