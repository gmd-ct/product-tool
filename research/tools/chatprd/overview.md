> "ChatPRD is the only AI copilot built specifically for product managers and their teams."

## Origin Story

Claire Vo, a 3x Chief Product Officer (currently at LaunchDarkly), built ChatPRD to solve her own problem. Writing PRDs is repetitive and time-consuming. When ChatGPT launched, she found it passable for writing PRDs but wanted something better.

She first built ChatPRD as a custom GPT, then evolved it into a full platform. Remarkably, she built all of ChatPRD herself—over a single weekend—with AI.

## Market Position

- **10,000+ product managers** using ChatPRD
- **500,000+ documents** created on the platform
- **50,000+ product managers** have used the tool
- **Six figures in revenue** as a side project
- **AI-first** product management tool

## Core Value Proposition

ChatPRD acts as an on-demand AI product management partner that:
1. **Automates** repetitive documentation tasks
2. **Coaches** PMs to improve their skills
3. **Reviews** documents like a Chief Product Officer
4. **Generates** PRDs, user stories, and technical specs

## Security & Privacy

- **SOC 2 Type II** certified
- **GDPR/CCPA** compliant
- **Private chats** - Data not used for training
- Uses **OpenAI's enterprise privacy APIs**
- Data never trains their models

## Unique Position in Market

ChatPRD represents a new category: **AI-native product management tools**. Unlike traditional PM tools (Aha!, Productboard) that added AI features, ChatPRD was built AI-first from day one.

It's not a roadmapping tool, prioritization tool, or feedback management platform—it's specifically focused on the documentation and requirements-writing workflow that takes up so much PM time.
