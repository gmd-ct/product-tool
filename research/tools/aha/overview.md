## Company History

### Founding Story
Brian de Haaff and Dr. Chris Waters founded Aha! in the spring of 2013 in Menlo Park, California. De Haaff, a serial entrepreneur with experience founding multiple technology companies, set out to create product management software that would help teams build "lovable" products.

The company was conceived as 100% remote from day one—long before remote work became mainstream. This decision proved prescient during the global shift to remote work in 2020.

### The Bootstrap Movement
Aha! is notable for being entirely bootstrapped—no venture capital funding. The company has built to over $100M in annual recurring revenue while remaining profitable from the start. In response to this success, Aha! launched "The Bootstrap Movement" to help other companies grow sustainably without outside funding.
